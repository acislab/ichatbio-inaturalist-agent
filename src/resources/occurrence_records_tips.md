* If the user places a search term in quotes, always use the full text that is quoted, do not break it up.
* If the user specifies a scientific name, such as the binomial "Homo sapiens", always put the whole name in "taxon_name". Do not split it into parts. "taxon_name" also matches the taxon's descendants, so "Rattus" matches every species in the genus.
* Common names such as "birds" or "trees" fit "iconic_taxa" (for example Aves or Plantae) better than "taxon_name".
* Never guess a numeric ID for "taxon_id", "place_id", "project_id" or "list_id". Only set one if the user states the ID. This tool cannot look up IDs from names.
* If the user names a place, such as a state or country, and does not give coordinates or a place ID, you cannot search by it. Use "lat", "lng" and "radius" for a point and distance, or the bounding box fields for an area, but only if the user gives the coordinates.
* Searching by observer name is unlikely to work. "user_login" only matches an exact login name, so only set it if the user gives a login.
* For a whole year or a whole month, use "year" or "month". Do not give partial dates like "2020" to "observed_on", "d1" or "d2". The API quietly returns wrong results for them. Use "d1" and "d2" for a date range, in yyyy-mm-dd format.
* Searching by lists performs an OR operation. For example, a search for "iconic_taxa":["Aves","Mammalia"] will return bird observations and ALSO mammal observations, it will NOT return observations where both occur together.
* "quality_grade" has three values: research (community-verified), needs_id (awaiting identification) and casual (missing evidence or flagged). Together they cover all observations. Only set it if the user asks for it.
* To get only observations that have photos, set "photos" to true. To get only observations without photos, set it to false. To get observations of any kind, leave it unset.
* "list_id" matches observations of taxa on a list, from anywhere in the world. It does not limit observations to a place.
* There are no parameters for image quality, image content, observer skill or how common a species is. Do not choose search parameters that only partially fulfill the user's request. Instead, you should abort (don't set any search parameters) and explain why.
* Only use the "per_page" field if the user explicitly asks to limit the amount of information retrieved, for example "show me 5 observations".
* At most 200 observations are returned per request. "total_results" in the response is the number of matching observations, which can be much larger.
* Photo URLs are in the artifact data at "results[].photos[].url". They are changed automatically to point to the original, full-size image, so there is nothing to set for that.
* The API allows roughly 60 requests per minute. Do not send several searches when one will answer the request.
